## Overview

This page walks you through connecting a self-hosted Spaces cluster to
Upbound Platform. Connecting a space allows its resources to be observed in the
Console or hub API, and automatically connects the control planes it manages.

A connected space's resources are represented by a control plane named
`space-<space-name>` in the `default` realm. Its control planes are connected as
`<space-name>.<control-plane-name>` in the realm corresponding to their
namespace on the space cluster.

:::note
To connect a control plane that's not managed by Upbound Spaces, see [how to
connect a control plane](connect-control-plane.md).
:::

## Prerequisites

- A space to connect: the Kubernetes cluster running Upbound Spaces whose
  resources and control planes you want to observe, and a kubeconfig context for
  it.
- Upbound Platform hub, reachable from the space.
- Access to the Console, or `kubectl` configured with a `hub` context that
  targets the hub.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) 3.

## Step 1: Declare the space

Declare the space in Upbound Platform to assign its name and get a connector
registration token.

<Tabs groupId="connect-ui">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

1. In the Console, open the spaces view.
2. Select **Create space**.
3. Enter a name for the space.
4. Submit. The Console creates the space and immediately shows its registration
   token (see Step 2).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubectl" label="kubectl">

Write the space manifest. A space is cluster-scoped and has an empty spec:

```yaml title="space.yaml"
apiVersion: hub.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: Space
metadata:
  name: <space-name>
```

Create it. The registration token is only returned in the create response, so
capture it now (see Step 2):

```bash
REGISTRATION_TOKEN=$(kubectl --context=hub create -f space.yaml \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.registrationToken}')
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Get the registration token

Capture the registration token from Step 1. Use it to deploy the
connector in Step 3.

:::warning
The registration token is shown once. It's valid for 24 hours, can be used only
once, and can't be retrieved after being created. You may reissue the token,
which invalidates the existing token.
:::

<Tabs groupId="connect-ui">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Copy the registration token displayed after you created the space. The Console
will not show it again. Set it as an environment variable for Step 3:

```bash
REGISTRATION_TOKEN=<paste-registration-token>
```

{/*
TODO(branden): Document how to reissue a registration token from the Console
once the Console supports it. See GLO-1188.
*/}

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubectl" label="kubectl">

`$REGISTRATION_TOKEN` from Step 1 holds the token. Confirm it is populated:

```bash
echo "$REGISTRATION_TOKEN"
```

The token from the create response cannot be read back later, but you can issue a
new token for the same space at any time. Issuing a new token invalidates the
previous one:

```bash
REGISTRATION_TOKEN=$(echo '{"apiVersion":"hub.upbound.io/v1beta1","kind":"Space"}' \
  | kubectl --context=hub create --raw \
  "/apis/hub.upbound.io/v1beta1/spaces/<space-name>/registrationtoken" \
  -f - | jq -r '.status.registrationToken')
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Deploy the connector

Deploy the connector to the space. The connector completes the space's
registration, syncs its resources, and connects its control planes.

Set the kubeconfig context for the space cluster:

```bash
SPACE_CONTEXT=<space-context>
```

Create a namespace and a secret holding the registration token on the space
cluster:

```bash
kubectl --context="$SPACE_CONTEXT" create namespace upbound-system

kubectl --context="$SPACE_CONTEXT" --namespace upbound-system \
  create secret generic hub-connector-credentials \
  --from-literal=registrationToken="$REGISTRATION_TOKEN"
```

Install the connector chart with Spaces integration enabled:

```bash
helm install hub-connector oci://xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/hub-connector \
  --kube-context "$SPACE_CONTEXT" \
  --namespace upbound-system \
  --set connector.spaces.enabled=true \
  --set connector.hub.url=<hub-url>
```

Notes:

- `connector.credentials.existingSecretRef.name` defaults to
  `hub-connector-credentials`. Override it only if you named the secret
  differently.
- Override the provisioned connectors' settings under
  `connector.spaces.controlPlaneConnector.*` (for example `excludeResources` or
  `resources`). Each field defaults to the space connector's own configuration.

## Step 4: Verify the connector started

Confirm the connector pods reach `Ready`:

```bash
kubectl --context="$SPACE_CONTEXT" --namespace upbound-system \
  wait --for=condition=Ready pod \
  --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=hub-connector --timeout=120s
```

The space connector deploys a per-control-plane connector into each control
plane's host namespace. Confirm those pods are `Ready` as well:

```bash
kubectl --context="$SPACE_CONTEXT" --all-namespaces \
  get pods --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=hub-connector
```

## Step 5: Observe from Upbound Platform

View the space, its resources, and control planes in Upbound Platform.

<Tabs groupId="connect-ui">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

1. Open the spaces view. The space you created shows a status of **Ready**.

   ![The Upbound Platform spaces view showing the connected space with a Ready status.](/img/hub/connect-space/ready.png)

2. Open the control planes view. Two kinds of control plane appear for the space:
   - The representative control plane for the space, named `space-<space-name>`,
     in the `default` realm.
   - The space's member control planes, named `<space-name>.<control-plane-name>`.
     Each is created in the realm that matches its namespace in the space.

   ![The control planes view showing the space representative control plane alongside its member control planes.](/img/hub/connect-space/control-planes.png)

3. Open a control plane's resources view to see the resources synced from that
   control plane.

   ![A member control plane resources view listing its synced resources.](/img/hub/connect-space/resources.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubectl" label="kubectl">

The space reports phase `Ready` and a populated `controlPlaneRef`:

```bash
kubectl --context=hub get spaces
```

```bash
kubectl --context=hub get space <space-name> -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'
```

The member control planes appear as `<space-name>.<control-plane-name>` in their
realms:

```bash
kubectl --context=hub --all-namespaces get controlplanes
```

List the resources synced across this space. The `resources` endpoint takes a
`space` filter:

```bash
kubectl --context=hub get --raw \
  '/apis/hub.upbound.io/v1beta1/resources?filter=space==%22<space-name>%22' \
  | jq -r '.items[].metadata.name'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

### The space connector pods don't reach Ready

Check the pod status and events:

```bash
kubectl --context="$SPACE_CONTEXT" --namespace upbound-system \
  describe pod --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=hub-connector
```

The connector needs the `hub-connector-credentials` secret to exist before it
starts, and the registration token it holds must still be valid. If the token
expired or was already used, reissue it (Step 2), update the secret, and restart
the connector:

```bash
kubectl --context="$SPACE_CONTEXT" --namespace upbound-system \
  rollout restart deployment hub-connector
```

### The space stays Pending

A space stays `Pending` until its connector completes registration. Check the
phase:

```bash
kubectl --context=hub get space <space-name> -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'
```

If it doesn't become `Ready`, the connector hasn't completed registration.
Confirm the space connector pods are `Ready` (Step 4). If the pods are `Ready`
but the phase stays `Pending`, the connector can't reach the hub. See the next
section.

### The connector can't reach the hub

The connector pushes to the hub at `connector.hub.url`. From the space cluster,
confirm that URL is correct and reachable, and that any firewall or network
policy allows egress to the hub. Correct the value and upgrade the release:

```bash
helm upgrade hub-connector oci://xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/hub-connector \
  --kube-context "$SPACE_CONTEXT" \
  --namespace upbound-system \
  --reuse-values \
  --set connector.hub.url=<hub-url>
```

### Member control planes don't appear

The connector deploys a per-control-plane connector into each control plane's
system namespace on the space cluster. If the space is `Ready` but its member
control planes don't appear in the hub, confirm the per-control-plane
connectors came up:

```bash
kubectl --context="$SPACE_CONTEXT" --all-namespaces \
  get pods --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=hub-connector
```

If those connectors are missing, confirm the Spaces installation is healthy and
that the control planes you expect exist on the space cluster.
