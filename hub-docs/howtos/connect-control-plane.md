## Overview

This page walks you through connecting a Kubernetes cluster as a control plane
to Upbound Platform. Connecting a control plane allows its resources to be
observed in the Console or hub API.

:::note
To connect control planes managed by Upbound Spaces, see [how to connect a
space](connect-space.md).
:::

## Prerequisites

- A control plane to connect: the Kubernetes cluster whose resources you want to
  observe, and a kubeconfig context for it.
- Upbound Platform hub, reachable from the control plane.
- A realm for the control plane, and admin permissions within that realm.
- Access to the Console, or `kubectl` configured with a `hub` context that
  targets the hub.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) 3.

## Step 1: Declare the control plane

Declare the control plane in Upbound Platform to assign its realm and name, then
get a connector registration token.

<Tabs groupId="connect-ui">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

1. In the Console, open the control planes view for the realm you want.
2. Select **Create control plane**.
3. Enter a name for the control plane and confirm the realm.
4. Submit. The Console creates the control plane and immediately shows its
   registration token. Copy it now (see Step 2).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubectl" label="kubectl">

Write the control plane manifest. A control plane is namespaced, and its
namespace is the realm:

```yaml title="controlplane.yaml"
apiVersion: hub.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ControlPlane
metadata:
  name: <control-plane-name>
  namespace: <realm>
```

Create it. The registration token is only returned in the create response, so
capture it now (see Step 2):

```bash
REGISTRATION_TOKEN=$(kubectl --context=hub create -f controlplane.yaml \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.registrationToken}')
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Get the registration token

Capture the registration token from Step 1. Use it to deploy the
connector in Step 3.

:::warning
The registration token is shown once. It's valid for 24 hours, can be used only
once, and can't be retrieved after being created. You may reissue the token,
which invalidates the existing token.
:::

<Tabs groupId="connect-ui">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Copy the registration token displayed after you created the control plane. The
Console will not show it again. Set it as an environment variable for Step 3:

```bash
REGISTRATION_TOKEN=<paste-registration-token>
```

{/*
TODO(branden): Document how to reissue a registration token from the Console
once the Console supports it. See GLO-1188.
*/}

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubectl" label="kubectl">

`$REGISTRATION_TOKEN` from Step 1 holds the token. Confirm it is populated:

```bash
echo "$REGISTRATION_TOKEN"
```

The token from the create response cannot be read back later, but you can issue a
new token for the same control plane at any time. Issuing a new token invalidates
the previous one:

```bash
REGISTRATION_TOKEN=$(echo '{"apiVersion":"hub.upbound.io/v1beta1","kind":"ControlPlane"}' \
  | kubectl --context=hub create --raw \
  "/apis/hub.upbound.io/v1beta1/namespaces/<realm>/controlplanes/<control-plane-name>/registrationtoken" \
  -f - | jq -r '.status.registrationToken')
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Deploy the connector

Deploy the connector to the control plane. The connector completes the control
plane's registration and syncs its resources.

Set the kubeconfig context for the control plane:

```bash
CONTROL_PLANE_CONTEXT=<control-plane-context>
```

Create a namespace and a secret holding the registration token:

```bash
kubectl --context="$CONTROL_PLANE_CONTEXT" create namespace upbound-system

kubectl --context="$CONTROL_PLANE_CONTEXT" --namespace upbound-system \
  create secret generic hub-connector-credentials \
  --from-literal=registrationToken="$REGISTRATION_TOKEN"
```

Install the connector chart, pointing it at the hub:

```bash
helm install hub-connector oci://xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/hub-connector \
  --kube-context "$CONTROL_PLANE_CONTEXT" \
  --namespace upbound-system \
  --set connector.hub.url=<hub-url>
```

Notes:

- `connector.credentials.existingSecretRef.name` defaults to
  `hub-connector-credentials`. Override it only if you named the secret
  differently.
- `connector.sync.limitToClusterRoles` limits which resources the connector syncs
  to those authorized by the listed ClusterRoles. It defaults to `crossplane-admin`,
  so only Crossplane resources are synced. Set it to `[]` to sync all resources.

## Step 4: Verify the connector started

Confirm the connector pods reach `Ready`:

```bash
kubectl --context="$CONTROL_PLANE_CONTEXT" --namespace upbound-system \
  wait --for=condition=Ready pod \
  --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=hub-connector --timeout=120s
```

```bash
kubectl --context="$CONTROL_PLANE_CONTEXT" --namespace upbound-system \
  get pods --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=hub-connector
```

## Step 5: Observe from Upbound Platform

View the control plane and its resources in Upbound Platform.

<Tabs groupId="connect-ui">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

1. Open the control planes view. The control plane you created shows a status of
   **Ready**.

   ![The Upbound Platform control planes view showing the connected control plane with a Ready status.](/img/hub/connect-control-plane/ready.png)

2. Open its resources view to see the resources synced from the control plane.

   ![The control plane resources view listing the resources synced from the connected control plane.](/img/hub/connect-control-plane/resources.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubectl" label="kubectl">

The control plane reports phase `Ready`:

```bash
kubectl --context=hub --namespace <realm> get controlplanes
```

```bash
kubectl --context=hub --namespace <realm> \
  get controlplane <control-plane-name> -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'
```

List the resources synced from this control plane. The `resources` endpoint takes
a `controlPlane` filter:

```bash
kubectl --context=hub get --raw \
  '/apis/hub.upbound.io/v1beta1/resources?filter=controlPlane==%22<control-plane-name>%22' \
  | jq -r '.items[].metadata.name'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

### The connector pods don't reach Ready

Check the pod status and events:

```bash
kubectl --context="$CONTROL_PLANE_CONTEXT" --namespace upbound-system \
  describe pod --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=hub-connector
```

The connector needs the `hub-connector-credentials` secret to exist before it
starts, and the registration token it holds must still be valid. If the token
expired or was already used, reissue it (Step 2), update the secret, and restart
the connector:

```bash
kubectl --context="$CONTROL_PLANE_CONTEXT" --namespace upbound-system \
  rollout restart deployment hub-connector
```

### The control plane stays Pending

A control plane stays `Pending` until its connector completes registration.
Check the phase:

```bash
kubectl --context=hub --namespace <realm> \
  get controlplane <control-plane-name> -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'
```

If it doesn't become `Ready`, the connector hasn't completed registration.
Confirm the connector pods are `Ready` (Step 4). If the pods are `Ready` but the
phase stays `Pending`, the connector can't reach the hub. See the next section.

### The connector can't reach the hub

The connector pushes to the hub at `connector.hub.url`. From the control plane,
confirm that URL is correct and reachable, and that any firewall or network
policy allows egress to the hub. Correct the value and upgrade the release:

```bash
helm upgrade hub-connector oci://xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/hub-connector \
  --kube-context "$CONTROL_PLANE_CONTEXT" \
  --namespace upbound-system \
  --reuse-values \
  --set connector.hub.url=<hub-url>
```

### No resources appear for the control plane

By default the connector syncs only resources authorized by the
`crossplane-admin` ClusterRole. If the resources you expect aren't covered by
that role, they don't sync. Widen `connector.sync.limitToClusterRoles`, or set
it to `[]` to sync everything, then upgrade the release.
