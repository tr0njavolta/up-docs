Welcome to Upbound, the enterprise platform for Crossplane that helps you build
autonomous infrastructure platforms at scale. Whether you're already using Open
Source Crossplane or exploring control planes for the first time, Upbound
provides the tools and services to take your infrastructure automation to the
next level.

<!-- vale Google.We = NO -->
Upbound allows you to expose infrastructure across clouds, vendors, and systems
through a single programmable API surface that works for humans and intelligent
agents alike. Upbound powers this API surface with **Upbound Crossplane (UXP)**,
Upbound's enterprise distribution of Crossplane. Run UXP on a single cluster the
same way you'd run open source Crossplane, then host it at scale with Spaces. It's
the same distribution either way, delivering enterprise-grade reliability,
performance, and developer experience.

## What is Upbound?
<!-- vale Microsoft.Contractions = YES -->
<!-- vale Microsoft.HeadingPunctuation = YES -->

Upbound is the platform that helps platform engineers automate and build their
platforms.

The power of the Upbound platform is the **control plane**. A control plane is
software that controls other software by exposing custom APIs for your
infrastructure to automatically maintain your desired state. Upbound's control
plane framework lets you manage infrastructure and resources across clouds and
services.

**The value of control planes is building your own custom APIs to provision the
resources your users need.**

The control plane constantly monitors your cloud resources to meet the state you
define in your custom APIs. You define your resources and Upbound parses,
connects with the service, and manages the lifecycle on your behalf.
